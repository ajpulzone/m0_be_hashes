# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
*Remembering my flow through writing code to get the hash to print as I want. But honestly, it was a lot of fun and this came considerably easier than I was expecting.
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
*Note taking has been a lot of post its with cliff note on my computer screen (data types, git commands, etc" just to remind me of the right code/orders to write things. I tend to lean back on the lesson notes and google if I can't remember how to do something quickly if my post it system can't provide enough of a memory jog
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
*A little bit of both. Over the past week I have found that I should only give myself about 2-5 minutes of trying to figure it out on my own, otherwise it ends up being an unproductive struggle.
